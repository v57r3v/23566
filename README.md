Subject description 
This subject extends the foundational treatment received in 23115 Economics for Business   by   analysing   the   decisions   that lie behind the demand and supply   curves   in   markets,   and   the   forces   that   affect   aggregate   demand   and   aggregate      supply curves of the economy. The subject examines a   number of   core   issues   in   economics   such   as:   how   firms choose their production levels and how   their   decisions   are   affected   by   the   market   conditions,   how   consumers   choose   between alternative combinations of goods and services, how   government   conducts fiscal   and   monetary   policy   and which forces affect the long-run economic growth of a   country.   The   subject   also   equips   students with   the   basic quantitative skills needed to examine these   questions.
Subject learning objectives (SLOs) 
Upon successful completion of this subject students should be   able   to:
1. explain a   number of important extensions and   modifications to the theory   of   markets,   some   important   implications
of macroeconomic policy decisions and the forces that   affect   long   run   economic growth
2. critically evaluate a greater range of government   policies   at   both the   microeconomic   and   macroeconomic   levels
3. communicate critical evaluations of economic phenomena   in writing with greater   effectiveness.
Contribution to the development of graduate attributes 
This subject contributes to the Bachelor of Business and Bachelor of Economics by providing students with an enhanced understanding of foundational issues in economics. The students will learn how to model behaviour of consumers and producers using graphical and analytical framework. Economics for Business 2 thus extends the knowledge and skills students have developed in Economics for Business to prepare them for more advanced study in economics, finance and other areas of business that draw heavily on economic principles.
This subject contributes to the development of the following graduate attributes:
Communication and collaboration
Social responsibility and cultural awareness
Professional and technical competence
This subject also contributes specifically to develop the following Program Learning Objectives for the Bachelor of Business:
Demonstrate ability to work independently and with others as a member of a team to achieve an agreed goal (2.2)
Make judgements and business decisions consistent with the principles of social responsibility, inclusion and knowledge of Indigenous peoples (3.1)
Apply technical and professional skills to operate effectively in business (4.1)
This subject also contributes specifically to develop the following Program Learning Objectives for the Bachelor of Economics:

Teaching and learning strategies 
In this subject, students get involved in active learning through the entire semester. The subject is taught through a range of interactive activities, including the following:
Online Quizzes: Five computerized online quizzes will be provided during the course and the best three results will be counted towards the final mark (part of Assignment 1).
Lecture Slides: Lecture slides will be available several days before each lecture on the learning management system. Please note that a lecture is just a summary of the material covered in the subject and should not be regarded as a sufficient coverage of the subject matter.
Additional Notes: Since the subject has a quantitative component, the additional notes, extracts and exercises are supplied to complement the main textbook. These notes are available online. Tutorial questions will refer to the concrete questions and exercises to be studied in these additional notes.

代做程序编程语言ercises: Tutorial questions containing the homework for the next tutorial are available on the learning management system each week. The tutorials will typically have two parts, self-test Multiple Choice Questions and Open Questions. During the first several weeks an extra part on mathematical background will be added. Tutorial questions should be attempted prior to each class, where a tutor will present and discuss the solutions. Solutions to the tutorial questions will be available the week following the respective tutorial class.
Collaboration: Tutorials will provide an opportunity to discuss key ideas from this subject with your teacher and peers. Students will also have opportunities to directly interact with each other through the learning management system.
Feedback: The learning management website will be used extensively as a vehicle of communication between staff and students, including through the online discussion board. Students will also receive regular feedback through interactive tutorial sessions by completing online quizzes.

2.    group assignment   (weight 25%)
Objective(s): This addresses subject learning objective(s):
1,   2   and   3
Weight: 40%
Task: The individual   part of the Assessment   consists   of five online   quizzes.   See   the   Program   above   for   the
due dates. The questions will be similar   to the tutorial   exercises.   Three   best   results   of the five   quizzes will be counted towards the final mark with   a   maximum   of 5% for   each.
For the group   part of the Assessment, you need to form. a group   of 4   students   (groups   of 5   students   may   be allowed   in some cases).   More   information on the group assignment will   be   provided   on
Canvas. The group assignment must be   submitted   on   the   due   date.
Due: The dates for all assessments are listed the   program   schedule.
Criteria: *Note:   Late submission of the assessment task will not   be   marked   and   awarded   a   mark   of zero.
Further Since each quiz will   be open   on   Canvas for   a   sufficient   period   of time,   there will   be   no   possibility   to information: postpone the deadline for any   particular test. Do not leave the quiz to the last minute!
The group assignment task will also be available well   before   the   deadline. Do not leave the group formation until the last minute!   Plagiarism detection software, including for the   use   of AI generated   text,   may   be   used to ensure the work you submit   is your own.
